Project objective: 
    to build a small web application with HTML, CSS and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables viewing of data points in detail.

This app uses Pokemon API to load the data
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon

It's helpful to activate a JSON formatter extension to better interact with the API
